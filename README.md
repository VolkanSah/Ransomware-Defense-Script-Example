# Ransomware Defense Script Example
###### Black Python Scripts for EDU by Volkan Sah - simple codings for 'Offensive Security' (updated 6/2023)
This repository contains a Python script example that demonstrates a defense mechanism against JavaScript ransomware attacks like [JADE-EDU](https://github.com/VolkanSah/JADE-edu)
The script aims to decrypt encrypted files and protect against potential data loss caused by ransomware.

## Features

- Decrypts encrypted files within a specified target directory.
- Uses a provided encryption key to decrypt the files.
- Removes the encrypted files after decryption.
- Displays a ransom note to the user.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volkansah/Ransomware-Defense-Script-Example.git
```
Modify the script according to your specific needs. Update the target directory, encryption key, and any other relevant parameters.

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Run the script:

```bash
python ransomware_defense.py
```
The script will decrypt any encrypted files within the target directory, using the provided encryption key. The decrypted files will replace the encrypted ones, and the encrypted files will be removed.

After running the script, a ransom note will be displayed to the user.
